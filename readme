Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.
At first, the solution seemed daunting, especially with the complexity of constructing a tree. The assignment's reference to a priority queue was a clue, guiding the need to keep track of elements efficiently. Utilizing a map was key to maintaining these pairs. The crux of building the tree involved a sentinel value to signify unmodified nodes; reaching this value signifies completion, as all prior nodes have been accounted for and their codes printed. Following the assignment's structured steps simplified the process, although crafting the tree was a formidable task.
